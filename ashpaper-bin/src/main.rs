/// # ashpaper-bin
/// CLI for the [ashpaper crate](https://crates.io/crates/ashpaper), an inpterpreter for Esopo language AshPaper conceived by William Hicks. Now you can run poetry-programs from the command line!
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Take the following "poegram" called 'lovely-poem.eso' (in this repositories poetry directory):
/// ```txt
/// lovely poem
///   it is a calculator, like a
///       poem, is a poem, and finds
///         factori-
///           als
///   The input is the syllAbles
/// in the title, count them, as one counts
///   (q) what other poem, programs can be writ
///   (a) anything a Turing
///     machine-machine-machine
///     would do
/// re/cur
///     sion works too, in poems, programs, and this
///        a lovely.
/// poem or calculator or nothing
/// how lovely can it be?
///
/// ;; This poem-program (poegram?) calculates factorials.
/// ;; (I learned a lot from reading the poem 'other woodwork' by William Hicks)
/// ;; Input is the number of syllables in the title.
/// ```
///
/// You can run it with:
/// ```bash
/// ashpaper-bin ashpaper-bin/poems/lovely-poem.eso
/// ```
///
/// And it will produce the output:
/// ```txt
/// 24
/// ```
